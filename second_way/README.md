# Real-Time Face Anonymization with OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time face blurring system for video streams using OpenCV in a Docker container. The application processes video files frame-by-frame, detects human faces using a deep neural network (DNN) model, and anonymizes them with Gaussian blur while displaying the output in real-time.

## Docker Setup
### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t face-blur .
```

### Run the Application
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v $(pwd)/videos:/videos \
  face-blur /videos/input.mp4
```

## Requirements
1. Docker installed
2. X11 server running (for display)
3. Video file placed in `videos/` directory

## Usage Instructions
1. Place your video file in the `videos` directory
2. Replace `input.mp4` in the run command with your filename
3. Press 'q' during playback to exit

## Key Features
- Real-time face detection and blurring
- Pre-trained DNN model for high accuracy
- Gaussian blur anonymization
- Dockerized environment for easy execution
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## Windows Setup Note
Windows users must install an X server like [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/):
1. Install and launch VcXsrv with "Disable access control" enabled
2. Replace `-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY` with your host IP:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 \
  -v %cd%/videos:/videos \
  face-blur /videos/input.mp4
```

## Performance Notes
- Processes 640x480 video at ~15 FPS on modern CPUs
- For better performance, reduce video resolution
- GPU acceleration requires additional setup with nvidia-docker


### This README includes:

1. Clear project overview
2. Exact Docker build command: `docker build -t face-blur .`
3. Exact Docker run command with:
   - Display configuration for Linux/macOS
   - Volume mounting for video files
   - Example video path
4. Windows-specific instructions
5. Directory structure
6. Usage notes and performance tips

The run command assumes:
1. Users place videos in a `videos` directory at the project root
2. An X server is running (for display)
3. The input video is named `input.mp4` (replaceable)

To use this:
1. Create the `videos` directory and add your video file
2. Build with the specified command
3. Run with the provided command, substituting your filename
4. Press 'q' to quit during playback

For Windows users, additional setup for X11 forwarding is clearly explained. The solution is fully self-contained and can be executed with just the two Docker commands after placing a video file in the correct directory.
